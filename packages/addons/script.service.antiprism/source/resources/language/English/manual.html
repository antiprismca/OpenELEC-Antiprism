<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">AntiPrism is a
toolbox platform for securing the online presence, web browsing and
communications. It is implemented as a set of extensions to the
<A HREF="http://openelec.tv/">OpenELEC</A>-derived media center
software providing a universal and seamlessly integrated web privacy
solution for home and small office. It runs from a read-only file
system within a secure Linux operating environment bootable from a
USB flash drive, SD memory card, or installable on a HDD/SSD.
AntiPrism is activated with a password used as an encryption key to a
hidden file system. Once deactivated, it leaves no traces of its
operations. The computer device running AntiPrism can serve as a
media center for watching movies, streaming music and games, and
general web surfing with the included basic web browser, because the
basic <A HREF="http://xbmc.org/" TARGET="_blank">XBMC/Kodi</A>
external plug-ins functionalities are preserved and acting as an
anonymizing tool in the background.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">The main
differences between AntiPrism and other existing anonymizing Linux
derivatives (<A HREF="http://tails.boum.org/" TARGET="_blank">Tails</A>,
<A HREF="https://www.whonix.org/" TARGET="_blank">Whonix</A>,
<A HREF="http://dee.su/liberte" TARGET="_blank">Liberte</A>, etc) are
dictated by its purpose. AntiPrism provides, basically, a &ldquo;secure
anonymizing media center&rdquo;, a household device that would
normally do little when not being used for entertainment, but is now
loaded with new hidden powers. For example, you can anonymously
search, download and watch your torrents right on the device, without
a need to copy them elsewhere. Same time, it is capable to run a
&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; customizable secure website with web cameras,
home automation portal or your own online store. It can also run as
an intermediate or entry node in the anonymizing networks extending
their strength and improving availability. It has a noticeably high
performance, due to the fast <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd" TARGET="_blank">Systemd</A>
Linux backend with close to real-time IRQ response and low network
packets losses. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Current AntiPrism
version supports i386, x86_64 and ARM-compatible processors running
on a wide range of Intel-compatible PCs and Raspberry Pi.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">This manual covers
the main functionality of AntiPrism - an encrypted file system
(container), exchanging and verifying keys and authenticating
documents with digital signatures, email-like module allowing users
to send and receive emails while preserving privacy, anonymous
web-surfing, web-hosting, file sharing and onion routing.</P>

Do I Need AntiPrism?</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">As a matter of
	fact, the majority of web surfing, email, chat, VoIP or video
	traffic of the modern Internet is subject of global surveillance.
	The NSA&rsquo;s <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29" TARGET="_blank">PRISM</A>
	(USA), <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project" TARGET="_blank">Great
	Firewall</A> (China), <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORM#SORM-2" TARGET="_blank">SORM-2</A>
	(Russia) the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes#Overview" TARGET="_blank">Five
	Eyes Countries</A> and other <A HREF="https://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/government-surveillance" TARGET="_blank">similar
	initiatives</A> monitor many connections. While it may not appear
	disturbing, it is potentially dangerous, since any joke or search
	you may have carelessly made online can raise a &ldquo;red flag&rdquo;
	putting anyone on the government's list of suspicions persons. The
	results of it might be really unwanted, including restrictions in
	travel destinations, arrests or even imprisonment. Intranet
	surveillance is another issue, potentially affecting businesses and
	even private households.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Regional
	content restrictions &ndash; as an example, about a half of music
	videos on YouTube are blocked in Germany because of local copyright
	issues. By specifying ExitNodes outside of Germany through the
	AntiPrism's Settings, German AntiPrism users can access most all
	YouTube videos. Same applies to Netflix and other online services
	that limit the content availability based on the client's
	geographical location.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">The built-in
	onion router functionality can anonymize your entire network
	transparently, allowing to bypass regional content restrictions for
	devices like Chromecast, AppleTV or similar. Consider this, as a
	&quot;free VPN&quot; service in the country of your choice!</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Hidden
	personal websites &ndash; you can run them in AntiPrism, and nobody
	can trace their physical locations based on their public addresses.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">AntiPrism is
	free, open-source software &ndash; you can ensure there is nothing
	hidden by analyzing the source code and building the software by
	yourself.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">It is easy to
	configure, enabling it to fully operate even in very restrictive
	environments. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">While other
	existing tools may provide similar kind of functionality, they
	usually require a dedicated PC or handheld device to operate and do
	not provide a familiar and easy to use user interface. AntiPrism
	shares the PC, HTPC or RPi with the media center software. Any
	AntiPrism services can be accessed through your home theatre via a
	secure VPN connection.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><A HREF="http://i2pbote.i2p.us/" TARGET="_blank">I2P-Bote</A>,
	the I2P&rsquo;s messaging system requires exchanging identities
	before the secure communications can start. There is no convenient
	and secure mechanism offered for this purpose by I2P. AntiPrism
	provides such a mechanism through the web-of-trust and &ldquo;dead
	drops&rdquo; technologies.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">AntiPrism is

	organization due to malicious OS or third party software components.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enabling your

<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><A HREF="http://torproject.org/" TARGET="_blank">Tor</A>
is free software for enabling online anonymity and resisting
censorship. It was designed to make it possible for users to surf and
host on the Internet anonymously, so their activities and location
cannot be discovered by government agencies, corporations, or anyone
else. Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide,
volunteer network consisting of thousands of relays to conceal a
user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance
or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult for Internet
activity to be traced back to the user: this includes visits to Web
sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms.

and is published under multiple licenses.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">The built-in
AntiPrism web browsing, web hosting, messaging and file sharing

This technique is quite convenient and efficient, as the drop IDs can
be communicated via any common media (phone, email, chat, etc).&nbsp;
The AntiPrism's default dead drop's URL is built into the software.
All dead drop communications are anonymized with AntiPrism. Once
contacts are exchanged, I2P-Bote messaging can start between the
parties totally securely.</P>

<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Autostart:
AntiPrism will start with the system boot. When off, you can start
AntiPrism manually from the Programs menu.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Profile container:
path to the container file. You can create multiple containers; each
may hold separated sets of email contacts and identities.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Mount point: a
directory in which our container will be mounted.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Password-protected
screensaver: you can choose if your screen will be locked after the
certain period of time (you will need to use your container password
to unlock it).</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">File system type:
default is ext4. You can choose another type of file system if you
want to mount your container on another computer where ext4 is not
supported. Other choices are ext2, ext3, NTFS. Should be set before
the creation of container and kept.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Check file system
during activation: AntiPrism will check the container file system
before it starts. When errors found, AntiPrism will attempt to repair
them.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Backup file system
during activation: AntiPrism will create a backup of your container
before it starts. When enabled, backup path must be specified (should
be writeable and contain enough free space).</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Use TrueCrypt &ndash;
choose this option if you really want to use TrueCrypt (for advanced
users). Should be set before the creation of container and kept.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Run X terminal for
command prompt (requires keyboard): enabling this, you get a full
shell terminal when clicking the Cmd button. Obviously, one needs a
keyboard for this, that's why the default (off) setting allows only
executing single shell commands.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Debug log: enable
writing of extra debugging information into the log files.</P>

<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Here, you can
configure your anonymizing services: I2P, Tor, Privoxy; enable Kodi
web frontend, SSH and VPN access.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Keep anonymizers
data in RAM (new identity with every startup): when on, does not keep
the Tor and I2P files inside the container but in the RAM-disk.
Therefore, the networks have to be bootstrapped completely with new
identities created during every startup, which increases the
initialization time. After the initialization, the performance will
increase because no recording of the network data into the flash
memory is performed. When on, hidden website support is disabled.
Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable I2P: this
will enable I2P service and access to its ports via the firewall.
Default is on.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Bootstrap I2P via
Tor (requires Privoxy): this allows launching I2P in restricted
environments that block the bootstrapping servers of I2P. China is a
good example. By bootstrapping I2P via Tor, such a blocking can be
bypassed. Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable hidden
website: when enabled, activates the built-in hidden web services &ndash;
Hiawatha or Jetty (part of I2P) or both. The hidden web sites become
accessible under randomly-generated .onion and .i2p host names in the
Tor and I2P networks respectively. The .onion host names can be
retrieved from the system via SSH, while the .i2p host name can be
retrieved via the I2P web frontend. Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable Tor: this
will enable Tor service and access to its ports via the firewall.
Default is on.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">SOCKS port: TCP
port number to use for SOCKS connections. Default is 1080.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Use bridges: in
case, if your environment is blocking Tor bootstrapping, use Tor
obfuscating bridges to bypass that. When enabled, enter a number of
bridges in the Bridges string. The bridges can be obtained at
<A HREF="https://bridges.torproject.org/options" TARGET="_blank">https://bridges.torproject.org/options</A>
or by sending a request to <A HREF="mailto:bridges@torproject.org">bridges@torproject.org</A>
and entered in the same format, separated by comma. Fingerprints
supplied after every address:port are optional but recommended.
Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Run as a Tor relay
node: enabling this puts your appliance into the Tor network as an
intermediate/entry node. Exit node is always disabled. Default is
off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Run as a bridge
relay: enabling this hides your relay node from the list nodes and
makes it available only through the bridges requests. Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Advertized port:
TCP port number of your node registered with the Tor network. Useful
when running behind a NAT gateway with port forwarding when a
different port number is required to be visible from the outside
network. Default is 9050.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Listen port: actual
TCP port for listening at. Default is 9050.</P>

run as an obfuscating bridge node. Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable
obfs3/obfs4, obfs3/obfs4 port: specifies, whether 
obfs3 or obfs4 (preferable) should be enabled and their listening
ports (assigned randomly, but can be changed). Providing an obfs3 or
obfs4 bridge is extremely helpful to enable Tor/I2P networking for
users from China, Iran and other countries that implement traffic
blocking and analyzing technologies.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Entry/Exit/Exclude/Exclude
exit nodes: specifies sets of Tor nodes to allow/deny. Countries can
be specified as country codes in curly braces separated by comma,
like {de},{ca},{nl}</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable onion router
transparent proxy: enables support for transparent proxy connections
in addition to regular proxy connections. With traditional proxy
methods like SOCKS, setting up the proxy server itself isn't enough;
proxy-supporting applications must be chosen, and each application on
each machine using the proxy must be specially configured by the user
or network administrator to connect through the proxy. Sometimes this
isn't possible because an application doesn't support SOCKS, or the
administrator doesn't want users to know their traffic is being sent
through a proxy. These problems can be avoided by using the operating
system's packet filtering facility to redirect outbound connections
into a transparent proxy, so named because its presence is intended
to be invisible to clients. Default is on. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable Privoxy
(requires Tor): run filtering proxy that adds even more privacy and
removes lots of annoying stuff. Privoxy is configured to forward all
external network requests excluding the .i2p domains via Tor. I2P
requests are forwarded to I2P, and intranet/localhost requests are
handled directly. Caching is disabled. Default is on.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable Web Access:
enables the default web frontend of Kodi. Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable SSH: enables
SSH service. Default is on.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Enable OpenVPN
server: enables peer-to-peer OpenVPN server mode. Communications are
set up with a shared key that can be retrieved remotely with SSH from
the directory .openvpn of your container. Default is off.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Allow access from
any IP: you can restrict access to AntiPrism computer from other
devices by IP-address. When off, you need to specify a trusted IP

<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif"><FONT SIZE=6><B>Usage Scenarios</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><A NAME="STANDALONE"></A>
Generally, AntiPrism can be used as a stand-alone unit, with a single
securely-conected client or with multiple clients connected over an
unsecure network. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Stand-Alone
AntiPrism System</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>With this setup, you do not open the AntiPrism HTPC for any
external client connections. Disallow access from any external IP via
the Access Control configuration. The AntiPrism services will only be
reached via the XBMC user interface. Your torrents can be accessed
via the file manager of XBMC under /storage/.Profile/i2p/i2psnark
(default settings).

Client</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="AP_crossover.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=446 HEIGHT=274 BORDER=0><BR><BR>With
this setup, AntiPrism acts as an anonymizing proxy or gateway for a
single computer connected to it via a cross-over Ethernet cable.
AntiPrism is using WiFi to connect to the router. This configuration
does not need any additional VPN security as the link between
AntiPrism and its client is secure. 
</P>
<P>If Onion Router and Ethernet tethering are enabled, no additional
configuration of the browsing PC is required. It will be
automatically assigned with TCP/IP settings, and its networking
traffic will be transparently routed via Tor.</P>
<P>Otherwise, the TCP/IP settings of the Ethernet link are set
automatically with <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking" TARGET="_blank">ZeroConf</A>.
You should set the external web browser's proxy settings with the IP
address of the Ethernet interface of AntiPrism (you can find it under
the Connections settings). Protocol and port settings for the proxy
depend on what AntiPrism services are enabled. Use HTTP/HTTPS proxy
with port 8118 by default. 
</P>
<P>I2P services can be accessed from the external web browser via the
IP address of AntiPrism, port 7657. Trusted IP should be set in the
Access Control configuration to the IP address of the connected
computer. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><A NAME="ONIONR"></A>
<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Onion Router</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>With this setup, AntiPrism acts as a anonymizing gateway that
routes all outgoing connections from the LAN and local host clients
transparently via the Tor network. This feature is extremely handy
when used with software or external devices that do not support or
ignore proxy configuration. Make sure wireless or Ethernet tethering
is enabled in the OpenELEC Network Settings for this feature to work
with the external devices. 
</P>
<P>WARNING: Tethered Ethernet interface should never be connected to
corporate networks as it will disrupt the normal operation of these
networks!</P>
<P>Since there is no additional VPN data encryption applied to the
LAN segment of the network path, this setup should only be used with
trusted local networks. For non-trusted networks with possible spying
/ sniffing of the traffic, use the Multiple VPN Clients setup.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><A NAME="MULTIVPN"></A>
<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif"><FONT SIZE=5><B>Multiple VPN Clients</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>With this setup, AntiPrism acts as an anonymizing proxy for a
group of computers in a non-trusted network. Since nobody can
guarantee absence of spying Ethernet network components, setting up
VPN access is strongly recommended. AntiPrism supports <A HREF="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/miscellaneous/78-static-key-mini-howto.html" TARGET="_blank">OpenVPN
protocol with a shared static key</A>. The key can be retrieved from
the /storage/.Profile/.openvpn encrypted container's directory of the
active AntiPrism system via SSH access. Disabling, reactivating,
enabling and again reactivating OpenVPN or SSH services re-creates
their keys.

<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif"><FONT SIZE=6><B>Hosting a hidden
website</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">AntiPrism supports
both Tor`s .onion and I2P`s .i2p hidden websites hosting. As about
the web server, both built into I2P Jetty and stand-alone Hiawatha
daemons are available. Web application support include CGIs in
Python, Linux shell scripts or Java. This is a great way of adding to
your AntiPrism a webcam, an online store, a home automation portal or
anything else, that will run anonymously, e.g. its physical location
is extremely hard to trace. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Web applications
can be installed from ZIP archives with the following internal
structure:</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">/ cgi-bin - put all
the CGI programs in this subdirectory</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">/ data - all the
data files or databases used with CGIs should be in this subdirectory</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">/ docroot - the
static document root subdirectory with index.html 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">README.txt -
details of the web application</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">The archive should
be unzipped using SSH into the web server`s root directory within the
encrypted container. For Jetty, it is i2p/eepsite/ ; for Hiawatha, it
is .hiawatha/ . Some examples of web apps are available at the
AntiPrism website.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Names of your
.onion or .i2p site can be retrieved from Tor or I2P after the hidden
website is enabled. Tor saves the .onion site name within the
hostname file created in the web server`s root directory. I2P allows
to retrieve the hidden web service name from its web front-end.</P>
